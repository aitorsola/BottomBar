# BottomBar

With this utility you can add to your application a sexy bottom bar.

Simply drag to your StoryBoard a UIView, change its class to 'MainBottonBarView', make an outlet right to your code and set it up with `func setItems(_)` method. This function accepts and array of `BottomBarItem`. In here, you can add an `UIImageView` and a block for when an bar option is tapped.
